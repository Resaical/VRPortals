Initial Guide

INTRODUCTION

This plugin focus on delivering the basic foundation to create portals in VR that achieve a seameslly teleport. The inspiration for this project are games like Tea for God ( add link) Traversal or Spellbound.
I believe that this kind of experiences and the locomotion that involves (no artificial movement, just walk) should be further explore to bring better experiences to XR. I worked in this project to get close developers to the feature by pre-making the most difficult challenges and providing an initial framework to develop.
DISCLAIMER: All the code is open and free to be modified and improved. At the same time, this was developed during a 2 month BUAS (Breda university of applied science) project. You also should expect some bug, problems and limited features because of the limited time it was developed.
